# Bayesian-Cone
Implemented the Bayesian Cone for Predicting Future Returns of Trading Algorithms after reading through the research paper by Sepideh Sadeghi and Dr. Thomas Wiecki. Evaluated trading algorithms using the back test results over a couple of years. Used Bayesian estimation and predicted possible future returns based on back test results. 

Compared the actual performance of the trading algorithm on unseen market data with the predictions generated by the model to check whether the algorithm is behaving as expected based on its back test or whether it is overfit to only work well on past data. My model generated a cone to predict the future returns. The accuracy of the model was 80+ on a scale of 100
