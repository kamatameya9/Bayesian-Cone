Implemented the Bayesian Cone for Predicting Future Returns of Trading Algorithms after reading through the research paper by Sepideh Sadeghi and Dr. Thomas Wiecki. Evaluated trading algorithms using the back test results over a couple of years. Used Bayesian estimation and predicted possible future returns based on back test results.
